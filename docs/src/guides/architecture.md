title: Architecture
---

Unlike React Inferno comes in a small individualized packages, this architecture is designed to give you the freedom to include only the parts of inferno that you use and keep your bundle size small. We also do not have a separate `inferno` and `inferno-dom` package, to get started with Inferno you can simply `npm install inferno`. 

However, this does not mean that you cannot use the same ES6 `Component` API as React, or `createElement`, they just come in separate packages.


## Inferno Component 

Inferno Component exists to give the same ES2015 API as `React.Component`. It defines a stateful component with all the [lifecycle methods](/guides/life)

## Inferno Create Class

## Inferno Create Element

## Inferno Server

## Inferno Router

## Inferno Test Utils

## Inferno VNode Flags

## Inferno Hyperscript

## Inferno Mobx
