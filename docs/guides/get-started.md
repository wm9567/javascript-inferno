title: Get Started

There are three ways to get setup with Inferno, the simple `create-inferno-app`, installation via NPM, or using the Cloudfare CDN. 

## Create Inferno App

Similarly to React you can get started by using `create-inferno-app`. Make sure that you have Node installed 

```
(sudo) npm install -g create-inferno-app
create-inferno-app MyFirstInfernoApp
cd MyFirstInfernoApp
npm start
```

Then navigate to [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8080) to view the application.

## NPM Installation
The core Inferno is packaged on NPM as `inferno`.

<div>
  `npm install inferno --save`
</div>

Which will set you up with the core package and everything you need to start creating components and rendering them, but you'll probably want to take a look at our [other packages]({{site.url}}/guides/architecture) for convenience. 

## Cloudfare
