# InfernoJS

Inferno is a very fast, light-weight, isomorphic framework that allows for rapid
and scalable application development. It utilises a virtual-dom and a very simple
JavaScript DSL that allows for greater flexibility than writing applications in
cumbersome DOM templating engines like Knockout and Angular.
